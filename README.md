  **Usage Notes**
  - The homepage will contain 4 buttons
  - The first button enables seeing and joining upcoming events
      - To join an event, need to click on the particular event item from the list
  - Admin may need to refresh the screen after deleting an event
      - After deleting, sometimes the event does not go away from the screen
      - You may need to delete twice or simple refresh/(go back and come back to the venue filter screen)
      - The error does not appear always and it took us a long time to even detect it
