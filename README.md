### 1. GoGo
<div style="text-align: justify">
GoGo is a website that connects individuals who want to explore events and experiences together while providing a platform for businesses to expand their reach.
  <p></p>
GoGo was built because many individuals encounter the same problem - the desire to attend certain events but lacking companionship for the experience. These individuals represent a consumer segment that businesses often miss out on capturing. GoGo resolves this issue by allowing one individual to reach out to others in order to invite them to a specific event created by a business.

  Since the project is undergoing development and is also part of our project idea for an ongoing course at the University of Toronto, the Github repository is private. But I am happy to show the code in an interview if required. Nevertheless, a figma mockup of the initial project interface is given below.

### 2. ENGG Timetable
<div style="text-align: justify">
This web application allows students at the Engineering Faculty of the University of Alberta to construct and visualize their course Timetables. The website makes this process interactive through making use of features such as Drag and Drop, Tooltips, Drodown Menus, etc.

    Currently, the project is still undergoing development and some of the information is the intellectual property of the University. However, a working copy of the project has been completed and  I am happy to show the code in an interview if required. A video demo of the working site is included below.

      - To join an event, need to click on the particular event item from the list
  - Admin may need to refresh the screen after deleting an event
      - After deleting, sometimes the event does not go away from the screen
      - You may need to delete twice or simple refresh/(go back and come back to the venue filter screen)
      - The error does not appear always and it took us a long time to even detect it
